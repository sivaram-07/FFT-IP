# The SignalTap Logic Analyzer 
It allows us to debug the design in real-time and at high-speed while performing an
analysis in the Quartus software.Using Signal Tap logic Analyzer, the outputs from the respective data output
blocks can be captured and analysed.
The output as viewed from the signal tap analyser is given below\

The diagrams below indicate the enabled sink_sop. This activation of sink_sop
signifies the incoming data packets(i.e)the input signal.

The activation of the source_sop is shown below. This indicates the start of FFT
points being displayed (both real and imaginary values).
